# Freon Service [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Joystream/substrate-runtime-joystream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Joystream/substrate-runtime-joystream)

The project is a ready-made box solution for comfortable work with multilingual applications. 

You can generate translations for different platforms (web services, mobile applications, third-party grpc microservices) in the same style inside the admin panel of this service, and also control the work of your translators.

This service is an embedded solution into your infrastructure to increase flexibility and reliability. Thanks to the docker build, you can easily add this service to your infrastructure.
The service consists of two parts - a backend written in Golang and a frontend written in ReactJS.
